Postings:Solution approach for large data sizes when using RSA While solving an error for large data sizes, what I found on Google is that RSA is not a good fit for large data sizes and is best used in combination with other symmetric key encryption techniques like AES and DSA. These encryption techniques allow us to encrypt and decrypt data with large sizes.Steps to follow in order to achieve the additional security:    1.    Use AES/DSA secret key to encrypt the data.    2.    Encrypt the secret key used in the previous step with RSA private key    3.    Send the encrypted data, encrypted secret key, and RSA public key to the end userEncryption-Decryption issue for large data size..!!I wonder if anyone has already started or done with encryption and decryption part. If so, has anyone faced issue while encryption or decryption of data related to byte size ? When I am trying to decrypt the data using RSA, it is giving me error something like data bytes are too big.Hi Professor,Thank you for the response. Yes, although it is not required to use encryption for our assignment, I was interested in giving it a try.I tried again and it's working fine now.
