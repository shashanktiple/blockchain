CLI inputs are also added once the basic blockchain is executed:
    a. 'C' : input displays the blocks verified by process on which this input was given
    b. 'R' 'filename': input will read the files and create the blocks based on the data.
    c. 'V' : Verifies the entire blockchain<br>
    d. 'V threshold' : Verifies whether the block's hash exceeds the threshold value.
    e. 'V invalid': Just and example to show if any block in blockchain is valid or not.
    f. 'L' : Displays block-number, timestamp and data in descending order.<br>
    Note for CLI: for these commands, it will print the statement in the process so after  all blocks are added just enter the input on the command.
